# What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to understand and communicate in the human language, whether spoken, written, or published. Rather than processing a specialized artificial computer language (like C++), the ability to process natural languages (like English) allows for a less technical way for humans to interact with technology.  NLP contributes to multiple fields of science including engineering, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, etc. To put this into context, think of how Siri answers a question on the iPhone, how essays can be scored automatedly, or how software can translate one piece of text from one human language to another. Software using NLP was first developed in the 1950s and is constantly being developed and improved. The goal of NLP, to make it seem as though there is purely human-to-human contact rather than human-to-computer, is not easily reached. One of the biggest tasks of NLP is breaking down text into smaller more understandable tokens. This task, tokenization, requires answers to questions both what and how. Based on a softwareâ€™s specific purpose, what happens with this collected information can be different and will help the overall software check grammar, translate, or even find trending topics.
